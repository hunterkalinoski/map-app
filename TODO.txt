!! IMPORTANT

!! Loading spinners while loading
    - one on initial page load, when fetching all the images
        - probably show background image with a loader on top of it

!! Change label buttons to checkboxes or switches
    - doesn't make sense as a button when they are on/off values

!! More pages
    - home/welcome page that directs you to a diff page for each map.

!! Create and import map 2


================================================
** LATER

** make ui look good
    - ensure ui also looks good on mobile


** Network optimized (images are only fetched once),
    but still laggy when doing actions with a lot of regions showing
    - lags a little on opacity changing, label switching, and even marking regions visible
    - to fix, possibly memoize some components with useCallback or useMemo
    - alternatively, limit number of selected regions to ~10
        - bad UX
    - importance to fix this is low atm

** Option to hide checkboxes (for when doing random, so answer isn't spoiled)
** Hotkey to go random, and toggle labels (for easy studying)
    - ex. clicking space goes next region, and 'l' toggles labels on and off
    - so you don't need to move mouse around so much, easier to study like this (quicker)


================================================
?? STRETCH:
    users can draw and submit their own maps
    users also have a db document, with their owned maps
    maps can be public or private
    home page shows featured maps (the ones i make)
    search page that shows publicly shared maps
    can view privately shared maps on your own profile page

needs a lot of optimization
seems to work okay locally, but when a lot of regions are showing at the same time, gets laggy
make ui look good
    - ensure ui also looks good on mobile
maybe pre-load all images, and instead of creating new <Image> components each time,
    - can just render them visible or invisible, based on if they are checked or not
    - (so blank map actually has all region <Image>s on it alreaday, just invisible)

!! IMPORTANT

!! Loading spinners while loading
    - one on initial page load, when fetching all the images
        - probably show background image with a loader on top of it

!! make ui look good
    - ensure ui also looks good on mobile

!! map 3 when assigned

!! test mode (iterate over all regions ONCE without label, prompting user to enter the name)


================================================
** LATER


** Option to hide checkboxes (for when doing random, so answer isn't spoiled)


** backend with auth and db.
	- users can sign in and store their test mode data (48/50, missed item1, item3)

** tips page that gives tips to study more efficiently
	- use spotify lofi music playlist
	- even though you aced a test, doesn't mean you know everything, so try again
	- study in small increments multiple times
		- 4 5 min sessions WAY BETTER than 1 20 min session.
